## Don't Say Fox (09/28/2024)
This is based on the TikTok account and website by [Alex Cheddar](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexCheddarUK). You can play his version of the game online at [dontfindthefox.com](https://donotfindthefox.com/).

## Dice Language (10/01/2024)
Simple regex parsing function which takes dice rolling notation and returns the value of the roll. I used [this guide](https://tableplop.notion.site/Dice-rolling-syntax-options-37ef6202bdc44e288b7eb84dc344dabc) for the syntax. For example, '2d6+3' would be 2 6-sided dice rolled plus 3 to the result.
- Future improvements: 
    - Usage of parenthesis
    - Order of operations for roll notation.

## Twenty Number Challenge (11/05/2024)
Based on a tiktok filter of the same name. In this game you are given a random number between 1 and 999 and have to put them in order on a list. If there is no space in the list or the numbers are out of order you lose.
