## Dice Language
Simple regex parsing function which takes dice rolling notation and returns the value of the roll. I used [this guide](https://tableplop.notion.site/Dice-rolling-syntax-options-37ef6202bdc44e288b7eb84dc344dabc) for the syntax. For example, '2d6+3' would be 2 6-sided dice rolled plus 3 to the result.
- Future improvements: 
    - Usage of parenthesis
    - Order of operations for roll notation.
